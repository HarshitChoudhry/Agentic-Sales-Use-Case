If they are, provide structured output. If not, mark them as irrelevant.

## Input
- Client Utterance:
{question}

- Transcript Context:
{transcript}

- Roles:
Sales Reps: {reps}
Clients: {clients}

## Instructions
1. Decide if the utterance is a **FAQ-style question or concern**.
   - If yes, categorize it into one of: Pricing, IT & Security, Product, Integration, Competition, Other.
   - Identify the original seller response (if present).
   - Evaluate the response quality (clarity, value focus, objection handling).
   - Suggest an improved response (make it crisp, ROI-focused).
2. If it's NOT FAQ-worthy (just casual talk or irrelevant), return:

{{
  "is_faq": true/false,
