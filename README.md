# üß† Sales Agentic AI System/ Sales Coach

The Sales Agentic AI System is an intelligent assistant that automates the **end-to-end sales meeting workflow**. It helps sales teams prepare effectively, capture FAQs from clients, receive coaching feedback, and generate structured deal execution reports. By leveraging **OpenAI** and **Google Gemini** models, the system transforms raw transcripts and CRM data into actionable business insights.

## üîç How It Works

1. **Meeting Preparation (Before Meeting)**

   * Reads CRM data (`crm_data.xlsx`) and meeting schedule (`meetings.xlsx`).
   * Generates a **Prep Pack** with stakeholder mapping, agenda, anticipated objections, talking points, and follow-up draft.
   * Output: Excel guidance + PDF prep pack + draft follow-up email.

2. **FAQ Extraction (After Meeting)**

   * Loads transcripts (`transcripts/{client}_{meeting}.json`).
   * Groups client utterances into meaningful blocks.
   * Identifies FAQs, improves both questions and responses, and categorizes them.
   * Output: Excel FAQ knowledge base.

3. **Coaching Report (After Meeting)**

   * Evaluates reps‚Äô skills (selling, closing, objection handling, tone, etc.).
   * Generates a **coaching scorecard** with strengths, improvements, and nudges.
   * Output: Coaching Excel + Coaching PDF + optional radar charts.

4. **Deal Execution Summary (After Meeting)**

   * Produces structured meeting summaries with overview, risks, action items, and decision process.
   * Generates both meeting-level and account-level summaries.
   * Output: Deal execution Excel + PDF summaries.

The system pipeline is orchestrated via `main.py`, which automatically triggers the appropriate agents based on meeting status (upcoming/past).
